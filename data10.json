They do threaten privacy, they do tend to have an overreach on citizen rights in many ways but most governments do have these laws that are about extraordinary times, and pandemics are extraordinary times when they can take these measures. So, that’s kind of an allowed thing, it’s not like there’s anything wrong with that, but the way that it pans out is very problematic. One thing that a lot of people have been worrying about is that it’s very likely that the shifts that we see like this, could lead to an increasing normalisation of surveillance.",

    "content": "This entire social media thing happened where we thought we should do something, and we should share the stories with our partners - we also made sure that because there was a lot of misinformation about Covid, with a certain community being blamed, and a lot of myths around where it comes from. All of this is prevalent not just among communities that are that do not have that kind of education, but also very well educated people, so in our communication and we have been making efforts to share simple posters and videos about Covid to sort of bust that misinformation, so we are using technology for that as well.",

    "content": "Some of our CBO partners like the CBO leader and couple of volunteers they were stopped by uniform police officers officials saying that you cannot go and distribute do you have a pass obviously and they’ve not gone for the distribution. For the first time the vehicle has a pass, the vehicle driver knows everything, and they’ve been stopped and told go walking and only one person can go -  even three persons cannot lift a 25 KG bag of rice! We will be taking so many kits for relief operations and believe me, they traumatised them so much. Even today if I ask that person, what’s your lockdown experience -  she will repeat this to me for the 10th time, because it was their risking their lives, their health and they’re not violating any rules, any precautions, or anything like that. In a couple of places, they were detained when they were returning because some of them, only a few of them per talukor per district had Permission so they will travel sometimes 200 km and 46° heat and return by 12. Once an auto was detained after returning from distribution because that auto driver supported our community people, he is at risk and nobody to help, so volunteers had to go all the way go back to the police station to get him released. This happened and in one or two of the cases, a community member was detained at the police station for 3-4 hours a- ll this would happen only when they are returning when it’s done, when it’s dark, and fewer people can come and support.",

We rely heavily on our CBO partners because something that you must have understood from your interviews, is that these are our partners and we come from an understanding that these are the people who have the best experts of their reality. So what LF does is to have a mutual exchange of knowledge so, for example, while coordinating we tell them that this is how much funding we can provide and you decide who to give or not to give because that’s not our decision to make, and can only be made by somebody who is working on the ground with the communities.",
